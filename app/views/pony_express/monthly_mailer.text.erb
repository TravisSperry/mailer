** Healers In The Forest
------------------------------------------------------------


** Columbus Childrens Theater
------------------------------------------------------------

Starting February 12th

A long time ago in a little farmhouse there lived a boy named Thomas who was very ill. One night a mysterious young girl named Salinia took him into a magic forest where he met “The Healers” -- fairy-like children who have the power to heal people through dance. Thomas was cured and returned home, unaware that Salinia was now in danger, for she had violated the King’s orders to bring Thomas to the Healers. Prepared to sacrifice his health to save her, he returned to the magic forest in a spectacular adventure which shows how an act of kindness could grow into a powerful force for good. A Regional Premiere with magical music by the author of CCT’s acclaimed production of The Hobo and the Miracle.

** Tips for the College Bound
------------------------------------------------------------


** At The Core
------------------------------------------------------------

Multiple Dates

The cost of college is rising rapidly. Students headed to college without a targeted career direction and a sense of their strengths...well, there's some risk to that. And, the job market they'll enter is constantly changing! Getting a degree does not guarantee a job. Students who have a strong concept of what they want to do are more likely to achieve their goals. But, how do they decide what to do?
