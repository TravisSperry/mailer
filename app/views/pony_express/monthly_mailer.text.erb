** The Emperor's New Clothes
------------------------------------------------------------


** Columbus Children's Theatre
------------------------------------------------------------

Multiple Dates in April

The Emperor needs new clothes, and Tom and Tina are the two unlikely tailors asked to create them. But they are not tailors, they are swindlers, and the Emperor is the target. Convincing the arrogant and conceited Emperor to wear the invisible clothes provides laughter and fun for all. A very funny adaptation of a classic tale performed by CCT’s Professional Touring Company and featuring audience participation.
