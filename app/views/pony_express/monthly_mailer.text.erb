** Frog Prince Columbus Children's Theater
------------------------------------------------------------

June 4th - 15th

You can’t judge a book by its cover. Would a prince be princely even if he was green and covered with slime? Would you kiss a frog that was mean, selfish and arrogant – even if you knew he was a prince? Join Columbus Children’s Theatre’s Professional Touring Company as we hop through the hysterical retelling of the Grimm Brothers’ classic tale of humility and forgiveness complete with audience participation.

This free presentation covers a wide range of ideas for students AND parents to consider on this journey. We will discuss practical, invaluable tips that will help any family plan effectively! Parents and students leave with great information to use immediately. This presentation was originally developed as a community service for the Worthington Libraries; it is NOT a sales pitch. Past presentations have been very interactive, and attendees should plan for a 90 minute meeting.
