Please complete a survey to ensure that we make each year better!

This is our third year hosting the event and we are continually amazed at the growth and participation we see from year to year. We sincerely thank you for your participation and look forward to seeing you next year.

If your student had one or many joyous math experiences and you feel compelled to share please email us at events@enrichcolumbus.org (mailto:events@enrichcolumbus.org) or leave it as a comment in the survey.
