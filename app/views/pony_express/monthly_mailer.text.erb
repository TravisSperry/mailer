** Puzzling With Minecraft
------------------------------------------------------------


** Math Plus Academy
------------------------------------------------------------

November 15th, 22nd

We’ve figured out how to turn your child’s love of Minecraft into a fun, educational experience.
Minecraft is a great game because it provides an ideal “sandbox” for building and exploring concepts, including mathematical ones.
We’ve built a special mathematical Minecraft world for students to explore. Students will be tasked with using their Minecraft skills to solve problems and optimize their resources using math skills along the way. Your Minecrafter will see math, and the game, in a whole new light.
