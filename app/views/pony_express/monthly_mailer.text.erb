** Story Teller: The Art of the Story Book
------------------------------------------------------------


** The Works
------------------------------------------------------------

All month long!

“Story Tellers: The Art of the Storybook” is curated by a Central Ohio illustrator and freelance artist for The Walt Disney Company. The exhibit captures the technical, whimsical, and educational components of storytelling through illustration. Original illustrations by local, regional and nationally known artists provide a glimpse into their unique creative progression by sharing five themed areas of the design process with the audience. This process acts as the common thread for each artist to achieve their final artistic accomplishment; the story book. This exhibition will remain on display until October 11.

** Harvest Fair
------------------------------------------------------------


** Stratford Ecological Farm
------------------------------------------------------------

September 27th

One of Stratford's biggest events of the year: a celebration of Stratford and of down-home family fun. Family-centered in every way, the farm is transformed into a playground in celebration of the season. With a variety of entertainment on the picnic area stage, a kids world--an active location with kites, stilts, face painting and a giant earth ball--and a hay bale toddler area with farm toys, kids of all ages can discover their inner farmer by climbing on a tractor, making apple cider, riding on a horse drawn wagon, grinding grain and more. Stratford sells home-grown food for lunch and volunteers provide an array of baked goods for sale.

** The Musical Adventures of Flat Stanley
------------------------------------------------------------


** Columbus Children's Theater
------------------------------------------------------------

Starting September 18th

One night, the bulletin board on the wall above Stanley's bed comes loose and falls – right on top of Stanley! The next morning, Stanley Lambchop wakes up flat. Not just a little flat... really, REALLY flat! In a whirlwind musical travelogue, Stanley – the ultimate exchange student – scours the globe for a solution to his unusual problem. He's stamped, posted, and cancelled from Hollywood to France to Honolulu and beyond. And whether he's thwarting a robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris, or “hanging ten” off the coast of Hawaii, Stanley is closing in on his goal of being a three-dimensional boy once more.
