Thank you for participating in this year's Dublin Summer Camp Expo. I am attaching a pdf flyer and asking that you spread the word to your network. Every little bit helps!

I'm also asking you to let me know if you plan on doing something special aside from handing out important information.

I will be marketing some of the different things going on and would love to share more with the registered attendees. Here are some examples:
* GameU will have live game demos
* Math Plus Academy will be bringing challenging puzzles
* Camp Wilson will be bringing some interesting animals
