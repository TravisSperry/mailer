** Ledgend Of Sleepy Hollow

** Columbus Children's Theater

October 31st

The lanky schoolmaster, Ichabod Crane, can't decide what's worse in the glen of Sleepy Hollow, the headless horseman or the silliest of ghosts, the horseless headman. To complicate matters Ichabod unwittingly vies with the local brute, Brom Bones, for the affections of Katrina Van Tassal. Ichabod endures a series of pranks and ghost stories, only to find himself on the ride of his life in this hilarious version of Washington Irving's classic short story.
